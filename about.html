    <p>
        Gardening was created in the 6th century by Busshist monks to help them reach deeper levels During medetation. They later used these gardens to help teach the principles and and concepts of Zen. The main parts of a Zen Garden are carefully raked sand or dirt juxtiposed with carefully splaced rocks. Plants can be added to a Zen Garden but they must be minimalist using lowspread plants instead of upright growing plants.
